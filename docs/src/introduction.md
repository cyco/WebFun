> In 1996/97 *LucasArts* released two games forming the *Desktop Adventures* series â€“ *Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures* and *Yoda Stories*. Both games are 2D puzzle games, featuring a top-down view, a variety of quests and randomly generated worlds.

**WebFun** aims to be a faithful re-implementation of the game engine driving the Desktop Adventures series and document to its inner workings.

This documentation describes various observations made while reverse-engineering the games. Some of it applies to *Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures* as well, but due to personal preference most of the reverse-engineering efforts have been focused on *Yoda Stories*.
