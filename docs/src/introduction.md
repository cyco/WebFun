> *Yoda Stories* is a game for Windows released in 1997. It is a 2D puzzle game where the player controls Luke Skywalker who has to walk around a world to collect items and solve puzzles. Each world is made up of different zones and generated randomly when the game starts.

**WebFun** aims to be a faithful reimplementation of the game engine driving *Yoda Stories* and *Indiana Jones and his Desktop Adventures*.

This documentation describes various observations made while reverse engineering the games. Some of it applies to *Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures* as well, but due to personal preference most of the reverse-engineering efforts have been focused on *Yoda Stories*.
