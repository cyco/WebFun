Documentation
=============

This documentation was built using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). `yarn build` will also trigger a documentation build if `mdbook` is installed.

You can trigger a manual build by executing the following command from the project root:

```bash
$ cd docs
$ mdbook build
```

*Mdbook* also supports starting a local web server to render a live preview of changs made to the markdown files:

```bash
$ cd docs
$ mdbook serve
```
