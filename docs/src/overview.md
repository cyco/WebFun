Overview
========

The desktop adventures game engine uses 32x32 pixel tiles for all of the graphics. Zones are made up of three layers of 9x9 or 18x18 tiles.

Each time a new story is generated, the game builds a map of 10x10 sectors, and semi-randomly assigns puzzles, items and zones to each sector to form a quest.
