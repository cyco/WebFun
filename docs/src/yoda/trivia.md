Promotional Screenshots
-----------------------

![Recreation of the promotional screenshots](../images/promo.png)

After getting my hands on an actual retail copy of *Yoda Stories* I became curious of the screenshots shown on the back of the box. At first glance they seem to be captures of zones \#95, \#294 and \#483. But after further inspection it's clear that none of the screenshots could have come from the final version of the game.

Zone \#95 does not have any actions that could place Luke's X-Wing in the zone as shown in the screenshot.

Zone \#294 is very close to the one depicted in the second screenshot, the only difference seems to be a missing crater tile next to Luke's head

The last screenshot was taken on a desert world. Zone \#483 has very similar building and wall structures, but the dewback in the top left corner is missing.

I've re-created the situation in each of the screenshots. They are available as downloads [here](./promo-1.wld), [here](./promo-2.wld) and [here](./promo-3.wld).

Interestingly enough, the italian version of the box uses entirely different images that actually look like screenshots from the real game.

Left-over Debug Window
----------------------

> Checkout *The Cutting Room Floor*'s entry on [Yoda Stories](https://tcrf.net/Star_Wars:_Yoda_Stories_(Windows)) for some more debug windows that are present in the program but can not be triggered.

Apart from the cheat codes there is a debug window that can be accessed using the key combination `ctrl-F8`. A modal comes up that shows the current zone id, position and the id of this world's goal. The shortcut works in both *Yoda Stories* and *Indiana Jones and his Desktop Adventures*.
