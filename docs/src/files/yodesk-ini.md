Yodesk.ini
==========

Data that persists between launches of a *Desktop Adventures* game, like settings, highscore and information about the last generated worlds is stored in a ini-file.

| Variant           | Path                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Yoda Stories      | `C:\Windows\Yodesk.ini`   |
| Yoda Stories Demo | `C:\Windows\YodaDemo.ini` |
| Indy's Adventures | `C:\Windows\Deskadv.ini`  |
| Indy's Demo       |                           |

The file is a standard [INI file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) with the sections `OPTIONS`, `GameData` and `Recent File List`.

The following is a sample file generated by `Yoda Stories`:

GameData section
----------------

The `GameData` section is to keep track of the zones last used on each planet. When a new world on the planet is generated, these zones are excluded. This is supposed to increase variety between consecutive games.

Each entry holds a comma separated list. The first entry is the last used PRNG seed while the rest specifies which puzzles were used in that story.
