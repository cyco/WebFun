## Cheats

On most websites for cheat codes you can find mentions of cheat codes like `BLASTERS` and `OBJECTS` that supposedly fill up the inventory with all items. These codes **do not work** and the executable does not even contain any reference to those codes.

_Yoda Stories_ does however contain two cheat codes that actually work. To input them you have to activate the `Locator` and type one of the codes. It is important to click the `Locator` in the inventory instead of using the keyboard shortcut `L` (the `L`-key is interpreted as the first character of the cheat code).

After successfully entering a cheat code a message appears on the current zone.

_Yoda Stories_ supports the following cheat codes:

| code     | message           | effect                                                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gojedi` | _Super Jedi!_     | Adds 5 Thermal Detonators, a Blaster Rifle, a Blaster and The Force to the inventory.              |
| `goyoda` | _Invincible!_     | The player's health is locked at the current value. Neither healing nor taking damage is possible. |
| `gohan`  | _Super Smuggler!_ | **Added in reimplementation** Unlimited ammo                                                       |

## Gimmicks

Apart from the cheat codes there is a debug window that can be accessed using the key combination `ctrl-F8`. A modal comes up that shows the current zone id, position and the id of this world's goal. The shortcut works in both _Yoda Stories_ and _Indiana Jones and his Desktop Adventures_.
