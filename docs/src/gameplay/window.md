*Desktop Adventures* are played in a window. There's no fullscreen mode and no resolution choices. The virtual world is rendered in a `288`x`288` pixel view. The player's item are dispalyed in an inventory table to the right. Each item can be clicked to pick up and then dropped on the scene. Below the inventory you'll find a *compass* that shows where the player can go, and indcator for the currently equipped weapon plus remaining ammo and a circular health indicator. As the hero takes damage this changes from green, over yellow and red to black. Once the black circle is completed the player dies and the game is over.
