The Desktop Adventures engine is almost entirely tile based. That means small re-usable images are used as the fundamental elements for all graphics. Maps, enemies and bullets are all made up of tiles.

> **Note:** Only the setup image and the speech bubbles are not rendered using tiles.

Each tile is made up of `32x32` pixels image data – an array of `8`-bit color palette indexes – and some flags that specify the properties of the tile.

### Locator

If the `Locator` type bit is set, these flags specify the sub-type. Some tiles required to render the map scene are not marked with special bit flags, so a hard coded list of tile ids per game is required.
