Cheats
======

On most websites for cheat codes you can find mentions of cheat codes like `BLASTERS` and `OBJECTS` that supposedly fill up the inventory with all items. These codes **do not work** and the executable does not even contain any reference to those codes.

*Yoda Stories* does however contain two cheat codes that actually work. To input them you have to activate the `Locator` and type one of the codes. It is important to click the `Locator` in the inventory instead of using the keyboard shortcut `L` (the `L`-key is interpreted as the first character of the cheat code).

|----------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
