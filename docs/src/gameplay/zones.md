Zones
=====

Zones are the game's maps, where the hero can walk around, solve puzzles and fight monsters.

They are made up of `9x9` or `18x18` tiles in three layers. A ground layer, and object layer, used for collision detection, and a roof layer that is rendered above the hero.

Each zone has a type that is used in the world generation process. See the following table for a list of zone types:

| Type | Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 16   | Use                | In order to solve this zone a tool must be used somewhere on the zone.                                                                                                                |
| 17   | Find               | `Find` zones provide an item without requiring anything else to solve them.                                                                                                           |
| 18   | Find Unique Weapon | One of these will be placed close to the town. it provides a unique weapon (*The Force* in Yoda Stories) to the player.                                                               |

Additionally each zone provides lists of tiles that can be used to solve the puzzle, NPCs that can be used to trade with and tiles that the zone can drop when solved. In the world generation these items are chosen semi-randomly to create a new story every time.

On the world map neighboring zones can be visited by walking off the current zone. Additionally zones are connected through doors.

In order to make zones a little more interesting to play and replay, the game includes a custom scripting language. These *actions* are defined per zone.

Special points of interest on a zone are marked by *hotspots*. These locations mark doors, or places where an item can be used or an NPC be placed by the world generator.

In Yoda Stories, every zone belongs to one of the following planets:

| Planet | Â Name    | Description                                  |
|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Tatooine | Desert planet, also referred to as Nevada    |
| 2      | Hoth     | Snowy ice planet, also referred to as Alaska |
| 3      | Endor    | A forest planet, also referred to as Oregon  |
| 5      | Dagobah  | Swamp planet, used in the staring world      |

Actions
-------

Actions can make zones more interactive and dynamic. They are used for example to implement switches and in-game cut-scene animations. Each action is made up of a bunch of conditions and instructions that are executed if all conditions are satisfied.

See [Scripting](../scripting/index.md) for a more detailed description of the internal scripting language.

Hotspots
--------

![Hotspots visualized in debug mode](../images/hotspots.png)

Each hotspot has a position on the map, a type, and a single argument. Unless disabled, hotspots are triggered by placing an item, walking to the location or removing the tile at the object layer underneath the hotspot.

The following table describes the hotspot types and their purpose:

| Type | Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
